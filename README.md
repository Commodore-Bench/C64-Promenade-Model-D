# C64-Promenade-Model-D
This is a remake of an  EPROM programmer, originally created by Jason-Ranheim. The project was made in co-operation with <a href="http://c64os.com">C64OS/Greg</a>.

I did the layout, Greg provided the information, has built the prototye and performed the testing (many but not all EPROM Types, that are listed in the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/C64-Promenade-Model-D/blob/main/Software/PromenadeC1Man.pdf">manual</a>. A prototype for me was provided by Greg.

So, here are the project files, which I have created, "as is".

Since I did not test the prototype in depth, I am not able to provide support for this project.
